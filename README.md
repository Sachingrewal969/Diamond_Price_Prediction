# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on their physical attributes using machine learning models. The dataset includes features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions. The goal is to build an accurate model to estimate diamond prices based on these characteristics.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv). It contains information about various diamonds, including their attributes and corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in csv format and can be found in the data directory.

### **Tech Stack**

***Programming Language***: Python 3.10

***Libraries***: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

***ML Models***: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

***Deployment***: Flask API with a Pickle-based model

### **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**

✔ Data Cleaning (Handling missing values, outliers)

✔ Feature Engineering (Scaling, Encoding categorical features)

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

✔ Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

### **Model Performance**

***Evaluation Metrics***:RMSE, R² Score

***Best Model***: XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters

### **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diamond_Price_Prediction.git
cd Diamond_Price_Prediction

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask app

python app.py

4. Access the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### **Results & Insights**

Carat weight has the highest impact on price

Cut, color, and clarity significantly influence the price

Feature scaling and encoding improved model accuracy
